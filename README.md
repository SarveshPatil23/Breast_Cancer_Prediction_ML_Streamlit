# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_ML_Streamlit
This app leverages machine learning to assist in diagnosing breast cancer by predicting whether a breast mass is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on cytology lab data. Python along with machine learning algorithm (Logistic Regression) and python library streamlit have been used in this project.
